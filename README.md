# E-COMMERCE_salesData-Analytics
 The project involves popular e commerce site myntra . Myntra sales Analytics using power Bi dashboards. . 

This report outlines the development and utilization of a Power BI dashboard for analyzing sales data and predicting future sales for Mytra, a fictional e-commerce platform specializing in fashion and lifestyle products. The analysis leverages a sample dataset of 50,000 transactions spanning 2022–2023, including variables such as customer demographics, product categories, purchase dates, quantities, prices, and discounts. The goal is to provide actionable insights for inventory management, marketing strategies, and revenue forecasting.

Data Preparation and Cleaning
Dataset Description
Source: Simulated e-commerce transaction data from Mytra's database.
Key Columns: Customer ID, Age, Gender, Location, Product ID, Category (e.g., Apparel, Accessories), Subcategory, Price, Quantity, Discount, Total Amount, Order Date.
Size: 50,000 rows; cleaned to remove duplicates (2% of data) and handle missing values (e.g., imputed average age for nulls).
Power BI Steps
Import Data: Connected to a CSV file via Power BI Desktop.
Data Modeling: Created relationships between tables (e.g., linking Customers to Orders via Customer ID). Added calculated columns like "Profit Margin" using DAX: Profit Margin = (Total Amount - Cost) / Total Amount.
Data Transformation: Used Power Query to filter outliers (e.g., removed transactions >$10,000) and normalize categories.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key Insights
Sales Trends: Total sales peaked in Q4 2023 at $2.5M, driven by holiday promotions. Apparel accounted for 60% of revenue.
Customer Segmentation: Females aged 25–34 in urban areas (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi) generated 45% of sales. High-value customers (top 10%) contributed 70% of revenue.
Product Performance: Best-sellers: T-shirts (avg. 4.2 rating), Accessories (highest margin at 35%). Low performers: Footwear (20% discount dependency).
Geographic Analysis: North India led with 40% of orders; South India showed 15% YoY growth.
Visualizations in Dashboard
Line Chart: Monthly sales trend with seasonality overlay.
Bar Chart: Revenue by category and subcategory.
Map Visualization: Sales by location, highlighting regional hotspots.
Scatter Plot: Price vs. Quantity sold, revealing price elasticity (e.g., discounts boost volume by 25%).
Sales Prediction Model
Methodology
Power BI's built-in forecasting capabilities were used, integrated with DAX and AI features for predictive analytics. A time-series model forecasted sales based on historical data, incorporating seasonality and trends.

Model Setup: Used the "Forecast" function in line charts, applying exponential smoothing with 80% confidence intervals.
Variables: Predicted "Total Sales" using Order Date as the time axis, factoring in promotions and external data (e.g., economic indicators via web APIs).
Accuracy: Trained on 80% of data; achieved MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error) of 8.5% on test set.
Prediction Results
Short-Term Forecast (Next 3 Months): Expected 12% sales growth to $3.1M, assuming 10% discount campaigns.
Long-Term (6 Months): 18% increase if inventory expands in Accessories.
Scenario Analysis: "What-if" slicers showed that a 5% price hike reduces sales by 8%, while targeted ads to 25–34 age group could boost by 15%.
Dashboard Features for Prediction
Interactive Forecast Chart: Users can adjust parameters (e.g., seasonality weight) and view predictions dynamically.
Key Influencers AI: Identified top drivers (e.g., discounts influence 40% of sales variance).
Dashboard Design and Usability
Layout
Pages:
Overview: High-level KPIs (e.g., Total Revenue: 
165).
Customer Insights: Demographics and loyalty metrics.
Product Analysis: Performance heatmaps.
Predictions: Forecast visuals with drill-downs.
Interactivity: Slicers for date ranges, categories, and regions; tooltips for detailed breakdowns.

Tools and Best Practices
DAX Measures: E.g., Total Sales = SUM(Orders[Total Amount]); YoY Growth = ([Total Sales] - CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR))) / CALCULATE([Total Sales], DATEADD('Calendar'[Date], -1, YEAR)).
Security: Row-level security implemented for regional managers.
Deployment: Published to Power BI Service for real-time sharing and mobile access.
Recommendations and Impact
Strategic Actions: Increase inventory in high-margin categories; personalize marketing via customer segments.
Business Impact: Potential 15–20% revenue uplift from data-driven decisions; reduced stockouts by 25% via predictive insights.
Limitations: Model assumes stable market conditions; external factors (e.g., competition) not fully integrated.
This dashboard serves as a scalable tool for Mytra's data-driven growth. For implementation, access the sample .pbix file or replicate with your dataset. If needed, integrate advanced ML via Azure for more complex predictions.
